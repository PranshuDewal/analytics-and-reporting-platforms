# Analytics and Reporting Platforms

This repository captures how I have designed, delivered, and operated enterprise analytics and reporting platforms used by internal teams and external clients. The emphasis is on data correctness, automation, and operational reliability rather than visualization alone. All examples are generalized from real production implementations.

## What this repository represents
- API-driven data ingestion and transformation
- Metric definition, validation, and governance

- Monitoring and operational support
